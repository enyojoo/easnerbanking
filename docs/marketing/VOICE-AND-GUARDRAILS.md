Last updated: June 8, 2026

Marketing copy for easner.com must align with product reality and legal pages under [`components/legal/`](../components/legal/). When marketing and legal conflict, **legal wins**. Product names: see [`NAMING.md`](NAMING.md).

| **Crypto app** / **trade crypto** / **buy Bitcoin** | Wrong category; not the product | Banking-simple money movement |
| **Available everywhere** | Jurisdiction limits in KYC policy | Supported jurisdictions; tier and partner rules apply |
| **Partner names on product pages** | UI stays Easner-branded | Easner product names; partners in legal/footer |
| **Live cards** / **Apply for your card now** | Tier 3 not generally available | Cards when available |
| **Bridge** | Deprecated | Omit |
| **Easner Personal** | Retired product name | Easner Personal Banking or Easner Mobile |
