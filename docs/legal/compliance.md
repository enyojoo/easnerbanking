# KYC/KYB and AML Policy

Last updated: June 8, 2026

---

## 1. Overview

**Easner Group, Inc.** (“**Easner**,” “**we**,” “**us**,” or “**our**”) maintains a compliance program covering know-your-customer (**KYC**), know-your-business (**KYB**), and anti-money laundering (**AML**) obligations across **Easner Mobile** (**Easner Personal Banking**) and **Easner Business** (**Easner Business Banking**).

Easner is a financial technology company. Banking, payment, verification, and related regulated services accessible through our platform are provided by **licensed partners**. Easner designs and operates the technology experience; partners perform regulated financial and compliance services under their licenses and regulatory frameworks.

This policy explains who may use our Services, how we verify customers and businesses, how we monitor for financial crime, and your responsibilities. For how we handle personal data, see our Privacy Policy.

---

## 2. Know Your Customer and Know Your Business

**KYC** is the process of verifying the identity of individual users.

**KYB** is the process of verifying business entities, their legal status, beneficial owners, and authorized representatives.

**AML** comprises the laws, regulations, and controls designed to prevent money laundering, terrorist financing, fraud, and other financial crime — including customer due diligence, sanctions screening, transaction monitoring, recordkeeping, and reporting to authorities.

Together, these programs help protect Easner, our partners, our users, and the integrity of the financial system.

## 3. Supported Jurisdictions

Access to Tier 1 global banking — including identity verification, virtual accounts, and fiat pay-in and pay-out — depends on **licensed partner** eligibility rules and Easner product availability. Countries offered at registration may reflect our current rollout.

### Eligibility principles

- You must be **18 or older** and truthfully represent your country of residence or business registration.
- All users and transactions are screened against applicable **sanctions and watchlists** (including OFAC, UN, EU, and UK). A match may block onboarding or payments regardless of country.
- Partners may require **Enhanced Due Diligence** for higher-risk profiles or jurisdictions.

### Prohibited jurisdictions

We do not onboard or provide Services to persons or businesses located in, ordinarily resident in, or organized under the laws of:

| Jurisdiction | ISO |
|----------------|-----|
| Cuba | CU |
| Iran | IR |
| Myanmar | MM |
| North Korea (Democratic People's Republic of Korea) | KP |
| Syria | SY |

We also do not provide Services in **Crimea, Sevastopol, Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk, or Zaporizhzhia** (sub-national regions; not selectable as standalone countries in registration).

These jurisdictions are excluded from Easner Business signup and KYB country pickers. Code: `packages/shared/src/jurisdiction-blocked-countries.ts`.

### Controlled jurisdictions

These jurisdictions are excluded from Easner Business signup and KYB country pickers unless explicitly enabled via an internal jurisdiction policy update.

### Other jurisdictions

If your country is not listed above, you may be eligible subject to partner approval, successful verification, sanctions screening, and Easner feature availability. **Tier 2 (African banking)** and other products may impose additional limits when launched.

Partner jurisdiction policies may change. We update our practices when material changes apply.

---

## 4. When We Verify

We conduct KYC/KYB when:

- You register for an account or before regulated features are enabled
- You send, receive, or fund an account through partner rails
- Virtual accounts, stablecoin deposit addresses, or card products are provisioned
- Periodic or risk-based reviews are required
- Your profile, ownership, activity, or jurisdiction changes materially
- A partner or regulator requires additional information

You may need to accept **partner terms** presented during hosted verification before certain services are enabled.

---

## 5. Information We Collect

### Annex A — Individual users (Easner Mobile / Easner Personal Banking)

- Full legal name, date of birth, nationality, and residential address
- Government-issued photo ID and proof of address where required
- Phone, email, and tax or national identifiers where applicable
- Employment, occupation, source of funds, and expected activity where required
- Selfie or liveness data where required for fraud prevention
- Verification status and related compliance metadata

### Annex B — Business users (Easner Business / Easner Business Banking)

- Legal name, registration number, jurisdiction, and business address
- Business website and customer-facing contact details where required for KYB
- Industry, nature of business, tax IDs, and registration documents
- Beneficial owners and persons with significant control (typically 25% or more, or as required by law)
- Authorized signatories and their identity verification
- Source of funds, expected volumes, and operational details
- Team members with access to the business account, where required for access control

### Document standards

Identity documents must be valid, legible, and match account information. Address documents are typically dated within the last three months unless otherwise specified. Non-English documents may require certified translation. We or our partners may request additional documents based on risk, product, or jurisdiction.

---

## 6. Verification Process

1. You create an Easner account.
2. You complete **hosted verification** with a licensed partner such as **Noah** (in-app or browser).
3. Automated and, where needed, manual review is performed.
4. Sanctions, PEP, and adverse media screening is conducted.
5. You receive an outcome: approved, pending, rejected, or a request for more information.
6. Upon approval, eligible accounts, payment rails, and features are provisioned by tier.

Most verifications complete within **1–3 business days**. Complex cases may take longer.

---

## 7. Our AML Program

Easner’s AML framework includes:

- **Customer Due Diligence (CDD)** — KYC/KYB before regulated services are used
- **Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD)** — for PEPs, high-risk geographies, unusual activity, or complex structures
- **Sanctions screening** — of customers, beneficiaries, and transactions
- **Transaction monitoring** — across fiat, stablecoin, and wallet activity where enabled
- **Suspicious activity reporting** — to relevant authorities when required
- **Recordkeeping** — typically **5 to 7 years** after account closure or last activity, or longer where mandated
- **Training and governance** — for personnel with compliance responsibilities, in coordination with licensed partners

Licensed partners perform identity verification, screening, and much of the transaction monitoring underlying our Services. Easner integrates partner outputs into account decisions, limits, and escalation.

### Transaction monitoring

We and our partners review activity for indicators such as unusual size or frequency, structuring, inconsistent use versus profile, high-risk corridors, sanctions exposure, and — for business users — patterns inconsistent with invoicing, Terminal, or QR Pay activity.

We may pause, decline, or request information about transactions pending compliance review.

### Suspicious activity reporting

Where we or a partner identify potentially suspicious activity, a **Suspicious Activity Report** or equivalent filing may be made to the appropriate authority. **We cannot inform you** when such a report is filed or an investigation is underway — this is required by law to prevent “tipping off.”

## 8. Tier Entitlements

| Tier | Description | Typical requirement |
|------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Tier 1 — Global banking** | USD/EUR accounts, pay-in/pay-out, stablecoin flows (and other currencies where enabled) | Approved KYC or KYB |
| **Tier 2 — African banking** | NGN and regional rails where launched | Tier 1 plus additional eligibility |
| **Tier 3 — Cards** | Personal or corporate cards when available | Separate partner approval |

---

## 9. Verification Outcomes and Limits

**Approved:** You may use Services within your tier, limits, and partner availability.

**Pending:** Some features may be restricted until review completes.

**Rejected:** Common reasons include invalid documents, information mismatches, incomplete files, sanctions concerns, or jurisdiction ineligibility. You may be able to resubmit where permitted.

We and our partners may impose transaction limits, corridor restrictions, or holds based on verification level and risk. Limits are communicated in the app or dashboard where practicable.

---

## 10. Your Responsibilities

You must:

- Provide accurate, complete, and current information
- Use the Services only for lawful purposes
- Cooperate with verification and information requests
- Notify us of changes to identity, ownership, or business activity
- Not evade sanctions, monitoring, or geographic restrictions

False or misleading information may result in account closure and reporting to authorities.

---

## 11. Your Rights

You may access verification status in the app or dashboard, request correction of inaccurate information (subject to regulatory limits), and contact us about the verification process. Some rights are limited by AML and recordkeeping laws.

For data held by a licensed partner, contact **legal@easner.com** and we will coordinate where appropriate.

---

## 12. Sharing and Security

We share KYC/KYB and compliance information with **licensed partners**, infrastructure providers, regulators, law enforcement, and other institutions where permitted by law and necessary to provide or protect the Services. See our **Privacy Policy** (Section 5.1) for named financial and infrastructure partners.

We protect compliance data with encryption, access controls, and confidentiality training. Partners retain data under their own regulatory obligations, which may continue after your Easner account closes.

---

## 13. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy as regulations, partners, or our Services evolve. Material changes will be posted with an updated “Last updated” date.
